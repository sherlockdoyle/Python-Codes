# Graph algorithms

This folder contains several Graph related algorithms with demos included. To run any of the demos, just add the correct import statement in [`main.py`](/graph/main.py) and run it.

## Implemented algorithms
- ### [Traversal](/graph/traversal)
  - **[DFS](/graph/traversal/dfs.py):** In depth first traversal we start from a certain vertex and try to go as deep as possible. We give preference to visiting the children instead of neighbours.
